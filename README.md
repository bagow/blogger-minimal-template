blogger-minimal-template
========================

a base template you can use to create stunning templates for blogger.com

blogger.com is a useful blogging platform but it only has some ugly base templates you can choose from. 
Luckily you can just hack your own.

This is a minimal template for blogger.com; it works out of the box because it's very simple. You can use this to
create your own template for blogger.com.

Why? Because even the simple template is very messy. I used this to build my own blogger.com template.
